# Internet Service Provider

This project includes the Internet Service Provider (ISP) web app. The frontend has the user interface where you can view the Services and their tariff packages:

- Internet

- IPTV

- Mobile internet

- Cable TV

The users can register and download the list of tariffs as a TXT, PDF, or DOCX file.

## UI features

You can view the list of tariff packages:

- By name (a-z, z-a)

- By price (descending)

## User account

The users need to sign up to select one or several different Services.

The registered users have an account. They can refill the balance. The system deducts and replenishes the user account depending on the Services selected by the user.

If there isn't enough funds, the system blocks the user. When the users refill their account, the system unblocks them automatically.

## Admin interface

The admin interface is a webpage where the user with the admin privileges can:

- Add, remove, or edit the tariff packages.

- Register, block, or unblock the users.
